The **Potential Induced Degradation (PID)** typically appears after the installation is commissioned and can reduce the performance a PV string by 20-80%, according to Libby et al. [1]. 


This blog post investigates the topic of Potential Induced Degradation (PID) in photovoltaic modules. It starts by giving an overview and definition. In a second section, it delves into the PD shunting mechanisms. Then, it includes some information on the electrical signature of PV modules affected by PID, detection methods, repair techniques and prevention actions against PID.

### I.	Overview and definition

As illustrated in Figure 1, the potential difference between PV modules and the ground increases with the number of modules in series. Then, PID, or Potential Induced Degradation, occurs when the PV system experiences significant voltage differences between the cell and the frame and leads to leakage currents.

As example, a study on a 10.7 MW power plant in Spain reported an average performance loss of 41% [1].

PID has many different forms and differ as function of the PV sandwich materials. The main types of PID are summarized in the Table below.

| Mechanism                  | Description                                              | Reversible? |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1. PID-p polarization      | Accumulation of charge density on the surface of the silicon | Yes         |
| 2. PID-s shunting          | Current leakage                                          | Yes         |
| 3. Electrochemical Reaction | Corrosion due to moisture infiltration                   | No          |


### II.	PID-s shunting

One of the most known PID degradation mechanisms is called PID shunting (PID-s) and appears when some significant electric potential difference causes leakage currents to flow from the module frame to the solar cells [2]. 
Factors contributing to the PID in photovoltaic (PV) modules include:
- **System Characteristics:**
Significant potential difference (several hundred volts) between the ground and the cell is the major cause of current leakage and the higher the voltage is, the more the PID can degrade PID performances.
- **Environmental Conditions:**
High humidity and elevated temperature enables better conductivity and facilitate current leakage. Also, positive charges coming from soiling [2] can accelerate the degradation process.
- **Module Composition:**
Low resistivity of encapsulation material (EVA) and a presence of a frame helps the electron diffusion process out of the normal electrical circuit. Also, a "soda-lime glass" with sodium concentration in the front glass would help the PID mechanisms.
- **Cell Design:** 
Standard Anti-Reflective Coating (ARC) layer including sodium ions also positively assist the process.

To explain PID in a nutshell, the potential difference between the cell and the frame at the ground causes 6 leakage current paths as illustrated in Figure 2. The most significant leakage currents pass through path 1. This leakage particularly increases in humid conditions, due to a higher conductivity of the front glass plate surface. [2]

</figure>

Due to the leakage current through path 1, Na+ ions are formed in the glass plate and:
1. Migrate through the glass layer (SiNx) towards the ARC layer.
2. Accumulate in the thin ARC layer (SiOx).
3. Infiltrate into defects of the P-N junction as "stacking faults".

In the stacking faults, the initial Na+ ions are neutralized by free electrons and allow other Na+ ions to follow in the stacking fault and go further. This stacking fault further eases and accentuates the leakage currents towards the frame. In other words, this mechanism creates a negative feedback loop and accelerates the degradation over time.

### III.	Signatures

PID originates from a non-optimal system conception and appears just after the commissioning. 
Some conditions enhance temporary the PID effect. At low irradiance, the loss of efficiency becomes more severe compared to STC conditions as the decrease in photocurrent makes leakage current losses predominant [2]. In the morning, significant losses may occur due to dew, which enhances the conductivity of the front glass. [2], [3].
Mostly heterogeneous among the module population [4], the PID electrical signature is characterized by a decrease in the shunt resistance $R_{sh}$  and increase in junction recombination parameters $I_{D2}$ and $n_2$ of the second diode in the two-diode model as illustrated in Figure 3.

</figure>

With regard to the evolution over time, c-Si PID (excluding the regeneration process) is directly proportional to the applied voltage and has been modeled as in the equation below according to Hacke et al.'s model [6]. This relationship specifically shows a exponentional degradation trend over time.
$V$ is the voltage, $E_a$ the activation energy, $k_b$ the Boltzmann's constant, $RH$ the relative humidity and $t$ is the time.

$$ \frac{P_{m}(t)}{P_{nom}} = 1 - V \cdot A \cdot e^{\frac{E_a}{k_B \cdot T_{mod}}} \cdot RH^B \cdot t^2  $$


Note that those models assessing the degradation over time are usually validated in laboratory but not in outdoor conditions where PID is a continuous tradeoff between degradation and regeneration [3]. 

Furthermore, PID might also lead to some other negative consequences as shown in Figure 4.

### VI. Detection

Visually detecting PID is challenging [7] and the failure recognition relies, then, on other detection methods such as electroluminescence, thermography, and UI tracing. Electroluminescence is the most spread and accurate technic to identify PID. IV tracing or direct Voc measurement are less accurate, but it can easily and quickly detect an anomaly from PID. Finally, infrared thermography will reveal the consequential hotspots from PIDs.

The IEC 62804 [8] serves as a standard for evaluating the impact of potential-induced degradation (PID) on PV crystalline modules. This comprehensive test entails exposing the PV panel to conditions including a temperature of 60°C, 85% humidity, a voltage difference of 1000V, all over a duration of 96 hours. A module is deemed to have failed the test if power degradation is over 5%.

### V. Repair

Except changing the configuration of the PV array to avoid high voltage, some regeneration techniques exist to temporary recover the PV panel characteristics [2].

On one hand, thermal regeneration involves the application of high temperature while maintaining low humidity levels. 

Electrical regeneration, on the other hand, utilizes the application of reverse voltage to restore the natural composition of the materials. For instance, the IEA report [7] illustrates a 94% regeneration after applying reverse voltage. However, electrical regeneration is never 100% complete due to the original induced corrosion + remaining Na in the "stacking" faults [2].

### VI. Prevention

When addressing potential-induced degradation (PID), some specific actions can significantly mitigate its impact, ensuring sustained efficiency over time. The target of those actions can be broken down into 4 categories as illustrated in Figure 5.

1.	Environment: Prioritize regular cleaning to remove accumulated soiling in order to minimize PID risk.
2.	System: Implementing measures such as setting the frame to a negative potential and utilizing "PV offset boxes" that apply reverse voltage overnight offer effective PID prevention strategies. [1].
3.	Module: Enhance the material encapsulation by considering alternatives like TPO, ionomer, or polyolefin [1], [2]. Additionally, replacing the front glass with a lower ion concentration variant can avoid PID [2].
4.	Cell: Increase the Si/N ratio to reduce sodium ion storage in the ARC layer [1], [2]. Introducing a SiO2 layer between the Si cell and the ARC layer has also been demonstrated to reduce PID [2].

In summary, this blog post investigates the Potential Induced Degradation (PID) in photovoltaic (PV) modules which can reach dramatic performance reductions. After covering its mechanisms, causes, electrical signatures and detection methods, some regeneration techniques and preventive actions are listed to avoid performance losses.
