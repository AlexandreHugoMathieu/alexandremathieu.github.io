In November-December 2023, a 20h course has been given to some Master students of the Solar Academy on PV fault detection.

The module content includes:

- **PV performance modeling** from weather variables (Irradiance in the plane of array, ambient temperature etc..) and system configuration, which includes:
   - Module temperature 
   - DC power
   - AC/DC efficiency
   - Performance metric calculations.

- **Failure detection** based on real production time series.

- Hands-on with **python** notebooks.

The repository which hosts the solar academy course on PV fault detection can be found [here](https://github.com/AlexandreHugoMathieu/pvfault_detection_solar_academy)

The course was derived from the workshop given at Datasun 2022. [Link to Datasun 2022](https://alexandrehugomathieu.github.io/alexandremathieu.github.io//publication/2022-11-14-datasun-workshop)
