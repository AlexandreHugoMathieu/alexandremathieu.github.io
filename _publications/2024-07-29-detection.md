This paper introduces an effective in-situ protocol to detect failures on PV installations.

Inspections of 48 photovoltaic (PV) modules within a 302.4 kWp solar array were undertaken to expose the presence of defects after 12 years of operation under the harsh environmental conditions of Djibouti. To this end, a multiple-technique testing protocol was conducted including visual inspection (VI), infrared thermography (IR), current-voltage curve characterization (I-V), ultraviolet fluorescence (UVFL) and electroluminescence imaging (EL).
