## Postdoc

Wind and solar generation forecasting

## Content

The objective of my postdoc is to contribute to the development of forecasting methods by focusing on three main tasks:

- Operational hybrid power plant (HPP) forecasting, including implementation, testing, and validation
- Large-scale wind and solar simulations, with a focus on pan-European forecast
- Support to IEA Wind Task 51 Forecasting [task website](https://iea-wind.org/task51/)

## Denmark Technical University (DTU) / DTU Wind Department

DTU Wind and Energy Systems delves into a broad research range. From investigating nanoscale structures to macro-scale atmospheric flow; from designing the turbines of tomorrow to the digital energy solutions of the future; from developing electric power systems to exploring more democratic processes for project planning.
