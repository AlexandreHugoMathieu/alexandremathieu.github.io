A warm welcome to my personal webpage !

Feel free to browse through the different tabs to read about my research work.

## About Me

I am a PhD student working on building photovoltaic applications. Especially, my work focuses on modelling failures as well as quantifying diagnostic methods in order to build a performance garantee on solar installations. My personal belief is that research owes to find solutions to mitigate the human environmental impact.

## Where I come from 

Originally from the mountainy area of Grenoble in France, I have been educated through two MSc in Engineering and Sustainable Energy respectively from CentraleSupelec (France) and DTU (Denmark). 

On my spare time, I love adventuring in the mountains, breathing fresh air and embracing the beauty of nature. My activities include hiking, ski-touring, climbing but also doing judo.

## Some random facts about me

1. Born, raised and living in Grenoble, FRANCE.
2. My desire of travelling and hiking led me to feel like an astronaut when climbing the Chachani Summit in Peru, 6000m in 2017.
3. As a kid, I dreamt about becoming judo world champion.

I am always happy to discuss new projects and collaborations.
