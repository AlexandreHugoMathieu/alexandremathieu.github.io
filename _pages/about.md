A warm welcome to my personal webpage !

Feel free to browse through the different tabs to read about my research work.

## About Me

I am now a Postdoc working on solar and wind generation forecasting at Denmark Technical University (DTU). My work focuses on operational forecast but also large-simulations at the pan-European level for system planning. My personal belief is that research owes to find solutions to mitigate the human environmental impact.

## Where I come from 

Originally from the mountainy area of Grenoble in France, I have been educated through two MSc in Engineering and Sustainable Energy respectively from CentraleSupelec (France) and DTU (Denmark). In 2025, I successfully defended my PhD on PV Performance guarantee with a collaboration between Heliocity, CSTB and University Savoie Mont Blanc.

On my spare time, I love adventuring in the mountains, breathing fresh air and embracing the beauty of nature. My activities include hiking, ski-touring, climbing but also doing judo.

## Some random facts about me

1. I heavily privilege trains to mitigate my environmental impact, and I came to a point where I have my preferences for most trains and stations in Europe: feel free to ask.
2. My desire of travelling and hiking led me to feel like an astronaut when climbing the Chachani Summit in Peru, 6000m in 2017.
3. As a kid, I dreamt about becoming judo world champion, and... I ended up Danish Champion in 2019.

I am always happy to discuss new projects and collaborations.
